- Count the number of shared duplications for each two pair of directories
- (shared duplicates x 2) / total number of files for the two directories = duplicate affinity ratio
- Sort directory pairs by duplicate affinity ratio

Todo: Collapse subdirectory with a duplicate affinity ratio of 1.
Todo: Should we have some sort of hierarchical affinity score that takes into consideration the score of subirectories?
